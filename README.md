# TheReadingGroup

## Why
This reading group is designed to create a collaborative and intellectually stimulating environment where both faculty members and PhD students can engage in in-depth discussions on research topics related to the creation, dissemination, and processing of digital information in business and management contexts.

## Format
Each session has a session chair (professors or senior doctoral students).
The session chair selects a focus topic and organizes a reading list clearly indicating the required readings.

### A session's focus could be in the form of 
  * Theoretical literature review and guided brainstorming
  * Methodology introduction and application
  * Paper development workshop
  * Research skill development
  * any other creative and engaging form of research development workshop
The session chair provides an overview of the topic chosen and the primary target of the session discussion. The session topic should emerge from the chair's research project or teaching needs. 
The session chair can engage doctoral students in reading and presenting. Students are also expected to read the materials, participate in discussions, and contribute as presenters/reviewers.
The session chair and other members can extend invitations to experts on specific topics to enrich the discussion (for example, authors of a paper in the reading list).
### Before each session
* 4 weeks: session scheduled
* 3 weeks: The topic and session chair will be announced. An initial reading list will be provided on the GitHub page.
* 3 - 2 weeks: All group members can contribute additional materials related to the topic selected. These contributions should be shared on the GitHub page, allowing all participants sufficient time to review the materials.
* 2 weeks: The readings and presenters for the session will be determined. Presenters will have two weeks to prepare for the session.
### Suggested Rundown
* Introduction (10 min): The session chair introduces the session's topic, focus, and expectations.
* Presentation (60 min): The session chair and students make one or two presentations. The presentation format depends on the choice of session focus and target. Presentations should be concise and focused to facilitate later discussions. In presenting other's work, the presenter should try to "own the research" in the presentation.
* Discussion (40 min): All participants ask questions, brainstorm ideas, or provide critical comments.

## The Proposed Benefit:
* Exposure to cutting-edge research topics and methodologies (within IS Economics focus)
* Research development - inspiration and critique
* Research presentation skill
* Research workshop organization and research training class development
* Extend invitations to experts on specific topics to enrich our discussions with their specialized knowledge and perspectives.
Session chairs are encouraged to select topics that are relevant to their research interests but also have broader appeal to ensure a rich and varied discussion. All participants are expected to come to each session having read the key materials and prepared to engage in a thoughtful and constructive dialogue. 

## Time & Venue
The reading group will meet biweekly on Friday nights. Each session will begin promptly at 7:00 PM and conclude around 9:00 PM. Any adjustment of the date & time will be announced at least two weeks before the session. Detailed schedules can be found on the GitHub page.
For participants in Hong Kong, we will meet in a designated conference room (location TBD). 
A Zoom link will be shared on our GitHub page for remote participants. Please do not share the link with outsiders, and do not record the session.

## Communication and Resource Sharing
A GitHub page has been established for the reading group. (https://github.com/sjsj0101/TheReadingGroup) This will be a central hub for posting schedules, distributing reading materials, sharing supplementary resources, and facilitating ongoing discussions between sessions. Participants will also use the repository to upload relevant papers, access information, and engage in discussions outside the scheduled sessions.
Feedback will be collected regularly from participants to assess the effectiveness of the reading group and to make any necessary adjustments. The group's format and topics may evolve best to meet the needs and interests of its members.

## Logistics
The members' list and email addresses will be posted on the GitHub page to facilitate communication. Members are by invitation only. If you have any questions about invitations or logistical matters, please contact Song, Jie at songjie@link.cuhk.edu.hk or Han, Miaozhe at miaozhehan@ust.hk.
