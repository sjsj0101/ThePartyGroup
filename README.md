# TheReadingGroup
## Why
The primary objective of this reading group is to create a collaborative and intellectually stimulating environment where both faculty members and PhD students can engage in in-depth discussions on a wide array of topics related to the creation, dissemination and processing of information in business and management contexts. 
A fundamental motivation behind this initiative is to cultivate interdisciplinary and cross-topic research, encouraging the sharing of diverse perspectives. All participants stand to gain from the exposure to a variety of research topics and methodologies. The reading group will also serve as a platform for networking, mentorship, and the development of collaborative research projects.

## Format
Each session will be structured around a topic proposed by one of the participants (preferably a faculty member). The proposing member will be the ‘chair’ of the session and be responsible for selecting initial reading materials, providing a brief overview of the topic, and guiding the in-session discussion. One or two key papers will be selected for students to present, followed by an intense discussion related to the topic.
### Before the session
* 4 weeks: The topic and session chair will be announced. An initial reading list will be provided on our GitHub page.
* 4 - 2 weeks: All other participants will have the opportunity to contribute additional materials related to the topic. These contributions should be shared to the GitHub page, allowing all participants sufficient time to review the materials.
* 2 weeks: The presenters and focal papers for the session will be determined. Presenters will then have two weeks to prepare for their presentations.
### During each session:
* Introduction (20 min): The session chair will introduce the topic, discuss existing literature, and outline the key concepts and questions to be considered during the discussion.
* Paper presentation(50 min): One or two focal papers shall be presented by PhD students. Presentations shall be concise. For empirical papers, the focus should be on the key contributions and empirical strategies. For theory or methodology papers, the key assumptions and theoretical framework should be clearly stated.
* Discussion (50 min): All participants are encouraged to discuss the paper, brainstorm ideas, and talk about how these new insights will contribute to their own work.

### Participation & Expectation
Participation is by invitation only and remains voluntary. However, PhD students are strongly encouraged to attend every session. Additionally, we will occasionally extend invitations to external experts on specific topics to enrich our discussions with their specialized knowledge and perspectives.
Session chairs are encouraged to select topics that are relevant to their research interests but also have broader appeal to ensure a rich and varied discussion. All participants are expected to come to each session having read the key materials and prepared to engage in a thoughtful and constructive dialogue. 

### Time & Venue
The reading group will meet biweekly on Friday night, starting September 6, 2024. Each session will begin promptly at 7:00 PM and conclude around 9:00 PM. Any adjustment of the date & time will be announced at least two weeks before the session. Detailed schedules can be found on the GitHub page.
For participants in Hong Kong, we will meet in a designated conference room (location TBD). For remote participants, a Zoom link will be shared on our GitHub page. We kindly request you do not share the link with others and do not record the session.

### Communication and Resource Sharing
A GitHub page has been established for the reading group. (https://github.com/sjsj0101/TheReadingGroup) This will serve as a central hub for posting schedules, distributing reading materials, sharing supplementary resources, and facilitating ongoing discussions between sessions. The repository will also be used by participants to upload relevant papers, and to access information and engage in discussions outside of the scheduled sessions.
Feedback will be collected regularly from participants to assess the effectiveness of the reading group and to make any necessary adjustments. The group's format and topics may evolve to best meet the needs and interests of its members.

### Logistics
The list of participants and their email addresses will be posted on the GitHub page to facilitate communication. Participation is by invitation only. For inquiries regarding external invitations or any logistical matters, please reach out to Song, Jie at songjie@link.cuhk.edu.hk or Han, Miaozhe at miaozhehan@ust.hk.
